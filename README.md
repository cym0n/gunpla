# gunpla
An online game of mecha battles

## Quick run

 * Build docker using mojolicious/docker/Dockerfile and name it gunpla
 * Change WORKDIR in run.sh to match the directory where you put the repository
 * Launch run.sh
 * Point your browser at http://localhost:7900
 * Choose a player in the docker game (consider having a second browser open on the other to play)
 
## Notes

Perl implementation is the relevant one. Solidity was just a brave try
